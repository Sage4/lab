            <h1>Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy</h1>
            <p>Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy is a Ukrainian politician, former actor<br> and comedian, who is the sixth and incumbent president of Ukraine.<br>

                Zelenskyy grew up as a native Russian speaker in Kryvyi Rih, a major city<br> of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in central Ukraine. Prior to his acting career, he<br> obtained a degree in law from the Kyiv National Economic University. He then<br> pursued comedy and created the production company Kvartal 95, which<br> produced films, cartoons, and TV shows including the TV series Servant of the<br> People, in which Zelenskyy played the role of the Ukrainian president. The<br> series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. A political party<br> bearing the same name as the television show was created in March 2018 by<br> employees of Kvartal 95.<br></p>
                
                <p>Zelenskyy announced his candidacy in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential<br> election on the evening of 31 December 2018, alongside the New Year's Eve<br> address of then-president Petro Poroshenko on the TV channel 1+1. A political<br> outsider, he had already become one of the frontrunners in opinion polls for<br> the election. He won the election with 73.23 per cent of the vote in the second<br> round, defeating Poroshenko. He has positioned himself as an anti-establishment<br> and anti-corruption figure.<br></p>
                
                <p>As president, Zelenskyy has been a proponent of e-government and unity<br> between the Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking parts of the country's<br> population. His communication style heavily uses social media,<br> particularly Instagram. His party won a landslide victory in a snap legislative<br> election held shortly after his inauguration as president. During his<br> administration, Zelenskyy oversaw the lifting of legal immunity for members of<br> the Verkhovna Rada, the country's response to the COVID-19<br> pandemic and subsequent economic recession, and some progress in<br> tackling corruption in Ukraine.<br></p>
                
                <p>Zelenskyy promised to end Ukraine's protracted conflict with Russia as part of<br> his presidential campaign, and has attempted to engage in dialogue with<br> Russian president Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy's administration faced an<br> escalation of tensions with Russia in 2021, culminating in the launch of an<br> ongoing full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. Zelenskyy's strategy<br> during the Russian military buildup was to calm the Ukrainian populace and<br> assure the international community that Ukraine was not seeking to<br> retaliate. He initially distanced himself from warnings of an imminent war, while<br> also calling for security guarantees and military support from NATO to<br> "withstand" the threat. After the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy declared martial<br> law across Ukraine and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His<br> leadership during the crisis has won him widespread international admiration,<br> and he has been described as a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.</p>
